# OBJECTIVE
An automated system to deliver drugs across several locations of the patients while also managing Healthcare Data.

# BASIC IDEA 
In the Healthcare data management system, Patient’s data will be classified according to their individual Healthcare providers and pharmacies. In addition, the medicine distribution system will extract the patients' medicine orders and will update the directories of various pharmacies for medicine delivery.

## FLOW
• Patients will receive services from the Healthcare Providers (Hospitals, Clinics, Consultants etc).
• Orders will be generated based on prescriptions given by HCP’s.
• Patients will be grouped based on their insurance providers and geographic location.
• Orders data will be separated into categories based on the pharmacies that will be distributing the
  medications.
• A periodic structure will be provided for the medicines being prescribed to different patients
